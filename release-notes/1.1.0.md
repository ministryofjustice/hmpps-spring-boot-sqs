# 1.1.0

Adding endpoint to allow retrieval of messages on a specified DLQ without removing them from the queue.
There is a limitation that this endpoint can only be called once every 30 seconds. The visibility of the read messages
is temporarily removed to prevent other consumers processing the message.

`/get-dlq-messages/{dlqName}`
