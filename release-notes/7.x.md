# 7.0.0

## Change to the Application Insights spans:

1. The `AppRequests` messages now contain the queue name in the `Source` field.
2. The `AppDependencies` messages now contain the queue / topic name in the `Target` field and the `DependencyType` is
   set to `Queue Message | aws_sqs` when sending a SQS message or `Queue Message | aws.sns` when publishing to an SNS
   topic.

Note that the `AppDependencies` change is a breaking change as it changes two of the fields:

1. `Target` was previously set to the same as `Name`, so normally `PUBLISH <event type>`.
2. `DependencyType` was previously set to `InProc`, but now starts with `Queue Message`.

Any Log Analytics queries that previously relied on these fields will need to be updated.

## Switch from Jackson 2 to Jackson 3 for internally parsing messages

This will potentially causing parsing issues with duplicate attributes etc. Jackson 2 also defaulted numbers to be 0
even if the field was mandatory and not supplied, Jackson 3 is more strict and it causes a parsing error.
