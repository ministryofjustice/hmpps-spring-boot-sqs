# 5.1.0

We now set the status code to `ERROR` and record the exception in the span when a message is processed. This means that
the `AppRequest` will now be recorded with `Success` of `false` if the listener throws an exception. The exception will
then also be linked by `OperationId` and have an `OperationName` set correctly too.

The downside of this approach is that the exception is also thrown by
`io.awspring.cloud.sqs.listener.sink.AbstractMessageProcessingPipelineSink`, however since that exception processing
happens outside the span, the `OperationId` isn't recorded. Exception logging is quite expensive in Log Analytics,
since it contains a full stack trace. This means that it is important not to record the same exception twice, so we
now have to ensure that the one without the `OperationId` is discarded.

The recommended approach to discarding the exception outside our span is to add

```json
  {
  "sampling": {
    "overrides": [
      {
        "telemetryType": "exception",
        "attributes": [
          {
            "key": "exception.type",
            "value": "java.util.concurrent.CompletionException",
            "matchType": "strict"
          }
        ],
        "percentage": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

to your `applicationinsights.json`. Note that we choose to sample at 10% rather than at 0, in case there are some
circumstances where the RECEIVE span isn't operational e.g. invalid message. We would only see 1 in 10 of those
messages, but that is better than not seeing any at all and sending lots of unnecessary logging to Log Analytics.

As a side note - it is worth removing any `@WithSpan` annotations from your listeners otherwise you will be creating
extra `AppRequests` unnecessarily since this library will also start a new span for you.

# 5.0.2

Updating dependencies:

- uk.gov.justice.hmpps.gradle-spring-boot:uk.gov.justice.hmpps.gradle-spring-boot.gradle.plugin [6.0.6 -> 6.0.8]
- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies [3.3.4 -> 3.3.5]
- org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib [2.0.20 -> 2.0.21]
- org.wiremock:wiremock-standalone [3.9.1 -> 3.9.2]

# 5.0.1

Bug fix - ignore `null` MessageAttributes in the payload and attempt then to parse message attributes instead.

# 5.0.0

## Breaking change:

`HmppsQueueService.eventTypeMessageAttributesNoTracing` has been removed, in preference to an additional `noTracing`
boolean parameter on
`HmppsQueueServiceeventTypeMessageAttributes` that defaults to false.

## New event type map methods

Helper methods `HmppsQueueService.eventTypeSnsMap` and `HmppsQueueService.eventTypeSqsMap` to make it easier to add a
`eventType` message attribute.
