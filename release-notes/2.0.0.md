# 2.0.0

This release targets Spring Boot 3.

We have also switched to [io.awspring.cloud](https://github.com/awspring/spring-cloud-aws) as the old java messaging library wasn't compatible with JMS 2.0. 

Updated the subscription to use Queue ARN rather than url - resolves an issue with invalid SQS ARN when subscribing with a protocol of `sqs`

Note that currently (as at 2023-03-31) reactive projects (which use spring boot 3.0.4+) need to change their config to include the following:
```
@EnableReactiveMethodSecurity(useAuthorizationManager = false)
```
due to a bug; see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/12821.
